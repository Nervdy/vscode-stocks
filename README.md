# Stocks

Keep an eye on your stocks while using VS Code, with the "Stocks" extension.

## Features

Add as many stock symbols as you like to the status bar, and they will be updated every 60 seconds. Just set the setting `vscode-stocks.stockSymbols` to an array of stock symbols to monitor. Example:
```json
"vscode-stocks.stockSymbols": [
    "msft",
    "aapl"
]
```

It can show symbols color-coded by gain/loss with the setting `vscode-stocks.useColors`.
